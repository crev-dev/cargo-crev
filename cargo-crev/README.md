> A cryptographically verifiable **c**ode **rev**iew system for the cargo (Rust) package manager.

## Introduction

[Crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/crev/) is a language and ecosystem agnostic, distributed **c**ode **rev**iew system.

`cargo-crev` is an implementation of Crev as a command line tool integrated with `cargo`. This tool helps Rust users evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of their package dependencies.

## Features

`cargo-crev` can already:

* warn you about untrustworthy crates and security vulnerabilities,
* display useful metrics about your dependencies,
* help you identify dependency-bloat,
* allow you to review most suspicious dependencies and publish your findings,
* use reviews produced by other users,
* increase trustworthiness of your own code,
* build a web of trust of other reputable users to help verify the code you use,

and many other things with many more to come.

## Getting started

Static binaries are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/releases).

Follow the [`cargo-crev` - Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/blob/master/cargo-crev/src/doc/getting_started.md)
(more documentation available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cargo-crev)).

`cargo-crev` is a work in progress, but it should be usable at all times.

## Raise awareness

If you're supportive of the cause, we would appreciate helping to raise awareness of the project. Consider putting the below note in the README of your Rust projects:

```
It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one.
```

Thank you!
